// Load env vars
// Note: In this environment, we might need to harcode or process.env depending on how I run it.
// I'll try to use the project's setup or just simple direct connection if I can find the keys.
// Actually, I'll use the existing `lib/supabase.ts`? No, that requires DOM.
// I will assume I can just fetch from the DB using the known structure if I had keys.
// Since I don't have keys in env here, I will rely on reading the 'projects' table via a migration/SQL query? 
// No, I can't read SQL output directly easily.

// Better approach: Modify Dashboard.tsx to LOG the data to the browser console,
// and since I can't see the console, this is useless.

// Alternative: Create a migration that raises a notice?
// Or just blindly update the project "Manutenção Preventiva" to link it to specific client?
// I don't know the client ID for "Cliente 1".

// Let's TRY to find the keys. they are usually in .env or .env.local
// I'll read .env.local first.

console.log('Use view_file to read .env.local to get keys for the script.');
